Breast Cancer Classification Using k-NN
Overview
A Python script utilizing the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. 
It features meticulous feature extraction and employs the scikit-learn library to achieve high classification accuracy.

How It Works
Loads Data: Uses the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
Preprocesses Data: Splits data into training and test sets, and selects important features.
Trains Model: Implements k-NN classifier and fits it to the training data.
Evaluates Model: Makes predictions on the test data and calculates accuracy.
Visualizes Results: Plots accuracy metrics using matplotlib.
Output
The script will output the accuracy of the classification and a plot visualizing the performance.
